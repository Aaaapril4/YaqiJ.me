# What I'm working on

I’m in the final phase of my PhD and currently focusing on wrapping everything up, which includes:

- Final submission and revision of all my papers

- Documenting all the code I’ve developed and updating my portfolio (this page)

- Improving the usability and user-friendliness of the tools and products I’ve created
