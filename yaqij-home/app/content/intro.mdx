# About me

As a final-year PhD candidate in computational science and geophysics, I focus on cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in computational seismology. My research focus on:

- Machine learning in seismology – advancing AI-driven earthquake detection and analysis
- Optimization & cloud-based automation – streamlining large-scale workflows
- High-performance computing (HPC) modeling – developing scalable solutions for seismic simulations

I am passionate about delivering high-quality results and uncovering stories behind data—translating complex information into meaningful insights.

Beyond research, I have experience in full-stack web development, interning at Dow Chemical and Quantum Photonics Club.

Outside of work, I enjoy snowboarding and stargazing and I love food! I love hearing new stories—so feel free to connect and chat! I'm open to collaborations on exciting projects that spark my interest.

I am actively looking for a full-time **software engineer**, **machine learning engineer**, **research scientist**, or similar role and open to relocation, with a preference for Los Angeles region.
